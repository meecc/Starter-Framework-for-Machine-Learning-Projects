# Starter-Framework-for-Machine-Learning-Projects
In this article I'll demonstrate some sort of a framework for working on machine learning projects. As you may know, machine learning in general is about extracting knowledge from data therefore, most of machine learning projects will depend on a data collection - called dataset - from a specific domain on which, we are investigating a certain problem to build a predictive model suitable for it. This model should follow certain set of steps to accomplish its purpose, In the following sections I will practically, introduce a simplified clarification about the main steps for performing statistical learning or building machine learning model
